Code Support Report – C#(CSharp) Advanced Edition v1.0.1
🔄 Structural Overhaul
In response to recent issues with repository cloning and Visual Studio compatibility, significant changes have been implemented:

- Removal of Special Characters: The '#' symbol has been eliminated from folder names to prevent conflicts during cloning operations. This resolves issues where special characters would cause cloning failures or misinterpretations in the Visual Studio environment.
- Standardized Naming Convention: Folder names have been standardized to a consistent format for improved clarity and accessibility.

📂 The Enigma
While these changes resolve existing issues, they also introduce new variables. The code has evolved, the paths have shifted. But for those bold enough to seek it out, the code will recognize your presence—if you let it.

🛠️ Looking Ahead
As the codebase matures, so too does the underlying architecture. As we continue optimizing, refactoring, and debugging, the structure adapts—ready for whatever comes next.
